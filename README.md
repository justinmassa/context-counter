## What It Does

Every AI has a "context window" - the amount of conversation it can remember. This extension shows you how full that memory is as you chat, so you know when you're running low.

## Features

- **Real-time tracking** - Watch your usage update as you chat
- **Works everywhere** - ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini
- **Visual progress bar** - Easy to read at a glance
- **Hover for details** - See breakdown by category
- **Warnings** - Visual alerts at 75% and 90% usage

## Privacy

**Your data stays in your browser.** This extension does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data, conversation content, or usage information. All processing happens locally in your browser. No data is sent to Remix Partners or any third party.
